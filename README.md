DevHub is a full-stack web application that my bootcamp team and I developed over a two-week period. The platform is built using React.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Redux, and Firebase. It is a social media website that is designed for developers to connect with each other and collaborate on development projects.

One of the unique features of DevHub is the ability for developers to create 'mobs', which are teams that they can work on development projects with. The platform also includes chat functionality, which allows users to communicate with each other and collaborate more effectively. Other features of the platform include the ability to create and delete posts, add and delete friends, and add pictures. Firebase was used for authentication and back-end services, as well as for the chat functionality.

Throughout the development process, my team and I utilized agile project management methodologies to ensure that the project was delivered on time and met the project requirements. As a result of this project, I gained valuable skills in full-stack development, including front-end and back-end development, project management, and team collaboration.
